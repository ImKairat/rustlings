// TODO: Hi, I would like to add more exercises about modules that involve the declaration
//  of modules in subdirectories and separate files. In this way, students can make sure
//  they understand better scope and privacy concepts and rules around the naming of directories
//  and files. Are you OK with that? Thank you
